    <p>My name is Jen - yeah that's a good start</p>
    <p>I am making this page because I realised that I was just going through the motions on Codecadmey,
      but would quickly forget the syntax, and anything else I had learned.
    <br>Best thing to do? Rather than just following the very the prescriptive tasks,
      I wanted to use what I had learned to create something which was at least vaguely meaningful for me.</p>
    <p>Hmm...what else do you need to know?<br>Apparently I like tiny cats and huge glasses of wine:</p>

      <p>I should probably stop jumping around and actually finish one of these courses, huh?
